# Artificial Intelligence 1 — MSc Business Analytics

This repository contains my coursework for the **Artificial Intelligence 1** course at ESADE Business School, as part of the MSc in Business Analytics program.  
It includes assignments and a hackathon project showcasing concepts from **machine learning pipelines** to **hyperparameter tuning** and **real-world price prediction**.

## Repository Structure
Each assignment and project is organized in its own folder with a notebook and a dedicated README:

- **[`ml_preprocessing_pipeline/`](ml_preprocessing_pipeline)**  
  *Assignment 1* — Building an end-to-end **scikit-learn preprocessing pipeline** (handling missing data, scaling, encoding).

- **[`model_creation_with_scikit_learn/`](model_creation_with_scikit_learn)**  
  *Assignment 2* — Developing predictive models with **scikit-learn** and evaluating them with key metrics.

- **[`cross_validation_and_grid_search/`](cross_validation_and_grid_search)**  
  *Assignment 3* — Understanding **cross-validation** and applying **grid search** for hyperparameter tuning.

- **[`airbnb_price_prediction_hackathon/`](airbnb_price_prediction_hackathon)**  
  *Hackathon Project* — Predicting **Airbnb rental prices** using machine learning with feature engineering and model optimization.
