# Cross-Validation and Grid Search

This notebook covers **Assignment 3** of the Artificial Intelligence 1 course.

## Scope
- Understanding **cross-validation** as a robust model evaluation method.
- Using **grid search** to tune hyperparameters systematically.
- Comparing performance with and without hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Learning
- Why k-fold cross-validation reduces overfitting risk.
- How grid search explores the hyperparameter space.
- Practical use of `GridSearchCV` in scikit-learn.
