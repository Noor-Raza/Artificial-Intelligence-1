# Machine Learning Preprocessing Pipeline

This notebook covers **Assignment 1** of the Artificial Intelligence 1 course.

## Scope
- Building a preprocessing pipeline using **scikit-learn**.
- Handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- Demonstrating how preprocessing integrates into the ML workflow.

## Key Learning
- How to transform raw datasets into a format ready for ML models.
- Importance of consistent preprocessing across training and test sets.
- Using `Pipeline` in scikit-learn to streamline workflows.
